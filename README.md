# Hi, I'm Lucien 👋🏾

I'm a Senior Software Developer Engineer based in Québec City, Québec, Canada. I've started doing web development back in 2014. I've had the opportunity to work with modern frameworks like angular.js, angular, react & vue.js. Also, I'm a proud father of a 2-year-old. I like watching movies, sports and listening to music. In my spare time, I like having a great time with my family and friends.
